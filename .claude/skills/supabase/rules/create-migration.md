# Database: Create migration

Apply these rules whenever you create or edit a file in `supabase/migrations/`.

This project uses the migrations provided by the Supabase CLI.

## Creating a migration file

Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the folder `supabase/migrations/`.

The file MUST following this naming convention:

The file MUST be named in the format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` with proper casing for months, minutes, and seconds in UTC time:

1. `YYYY` - Four digits for the year (e.g., `2024`).
2. `MM` - Two digits for the month (01 to 12).
3. `DD` - Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31).
4. `HH` - Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
5. `mm` - Two digits for the minute (00 to 59).
6. `ss` - Two digits for the second (00 to 59).
7. Add an appropriate description for the migration.

For example:

```
20240906123045_create_profiles.sql
```

## SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase migration files that:

- Includes a header comment with metadata about the migration, such as the purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations.
- Includes thorough comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each migration step.
- Write all SQL in lowercase.
- Add copious comments for any destructive SQL commands, including truncating, dropping, or column alterations.
- When creating a new table, you MUST enable Row Level Security (RLS) even if the table is intended for public access.
- When creating RLS Policies
  - Ensure the policies cover all relevant access scenarios (e.g. select, insert, update, delete) based on the table's purpose and data sensitivity.
  - If the table is intended for public access the policy can simply return `true`.
  - RLS policies should be granular: one policy per operation (`select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`). Always name the role(s) with `to`; list several roles (`to anon, authenticated`) only when the predicate is identical for all of them.
  - Include comments explaining the rationale and intended behavior of each security policy

After writing a migration, apply it locally with `npm run db:reset` and regenerate types with `npm run db:types`.
